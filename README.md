# MultiOmics Integration

Welcome to the **MultiOmics Integration** repository! This project focuses on integrating multi-omics data, specifically genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, to gain comprehensive insights into complex biological processes.

## About

The MultiOmics Integration project aims to combine genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to uncover correlations, identify patterns, and provide a holistic view of biological systems. By integrating multiple omics datasets, researchers can gain deeper insights into the interactions between genes, transcripts, and proteins.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains the following Jupyter notebooks:

- **omics_data_integration.ipynb:** This notebook demonstrates the process of integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to create an integrated dataset for downstream analysis.

- **visualization.ipynb:** This notebook illustrates how to visualize the integrated omics data using various visualization techniques.

## Data

The `data` directory contains example omics data files for testing and demonstration purposes:

- **genomics_data.csv:** Simulated genomics data for different genes and samples.

- **transcriptomics_data.csv:** Simulated transcriptomics data for gene expression levels across samples.

- **proteomics_data.csv:** Simulated proteomics data for protein abundance measurements.

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory includes the following Python scripts:

- **integrate_omics.py:** This script performs the integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, resulting in an integrated dataset.

- **visualize_data.py:** This script generates visualizations of the integrated omics data, helping to extract meaningful insights.

## Results

The `results` directory contains the output files generated during the multi-omics integration and visualization processes:

- **integrated_data.csv:** CSV file containing the integrated omics data.

- **visualization_output:** Directory for storing visualization output files.

## Usage

To get started, follow the examples and code snippets provided in the notebooks and scripts. Feel free to use the example omics data files for testing and adapting the integration and visualization processes to your specific needs.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance the multi-omics integration techniques or add new visualization methods are welcome! Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.
